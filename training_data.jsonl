{"text": "The film works as an entertaining spy thriller set in the corridors of the Vatican, but also as a serene reflection on commitment, power and faith.[Full review in Spanish]"}
{"text": "The movie was great until the turn no n the ending was such disgusting rewriting of anything that would happen in the conclave. Would give it a zero"}
{"text": "f it weren't for the ending I've have given this a straight 5 stars. As it was, the twist feels unnecessary and detracts from everything that's gone before."}
{"text": "Cage does go all in, but remains in control and never fully succumbs to overdone theatrics as in the recent past. It’s a performance that makes his unnamed “surfer” sad, tortured, pathetic, relatable and redeemable."}
{"text": "Horrible movie. At times made no sense, abstract, inane. More like B movie. I don't think that I've seen that bad of a movie in years. Save your $$."}
