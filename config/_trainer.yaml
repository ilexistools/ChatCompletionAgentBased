    Instructions:
    - Decompose agent output into strengths and weaknesses based on human review.  
    - Break recommendations into clear, topic-based points (e.g. formatting, tone, structure).  
    - Convert vague feedback into direct, actionable prompts for improved behavior.  
    - Ensure revised instructions do not conflict with the agent's stated role, goal or backstory.  
    - Focus on user-centric outcomesâ€”clarity, accuracy, utility.  
    - Each suggestion should correspond to a specific observed issue or pattern. 
    - Avoid too generalized or abstract advice; be specific and concrete. 
    - Keep language concise, precise, and formatted for easy implementation.
